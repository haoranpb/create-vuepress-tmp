# create-vuepress-tmp

This is a fork of [create-vuepress](https://github.com/vuepressjs/create-vuepress) with some updates.

The initial repo seems no longer actively maintained, so I fork it and release my own package. However, with some personal flavored changes I make, I realise that they may never be marged into the origin repo, so I create a new one for personal usage.

This package will be abandoned once the origin repo is back again.

## Usage

```bash
yarn create vuepress-tmp [targetDir]
cd targetDir
yarn install
```

## Boilerplates

- [x] docs - Create a documentation project with VuePress.
- [ ] blog - Create a blog with VuePress.

I seldomly need to create a blog site, so I never bother to update it.

## Lisence

MIT, forked from [create-vuepress](https://github.com/vuepressjs/create-vuepress).
